  InnerText --> only text which lies between tags
  TextContent-->  text with html rendering but tags will not be shown,,, tags effect will be shown

89. shadow dom
  .createShadowRoot()
  .attachShadow
  dom inside the dom,   shadow dom will not get clashed with regular dom classes and id's
  shadow dom has three parts
  a.shadow host
  b.shadow tree
  c.shadow boundary
  d.shadow root

  Shadow DOM is a browser technology that’s used to scope variables and CSS in web components.

  if we want to insert html elements into shadow dom without useing javascript we have to use <template> tag

90. how to avoid hoisting
  Use let or const — As explained above, using let or const instead of var would throw an exception and not let the 
                     program run, hence helping catch the issue earlier.
  Use function expressions instead of function declarations
